## The Analysis Phase in Software Development

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Requirement Gathering | Collect all functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. |
| Requirement Analysis | Study, clarify, and refine requirements to ensure they are complete and feasible. |
| Feasibility Study | Evaluate technical, financial, and operational feasibility of the project. |
| System Modeling | Create diagrams (DFD, use cases, ERD) to visualize system behavior and data flow. |
| Requirement Documentation | Prepare SRS (Software Requirements Specification) as a formal record of requirements. |
| Validation & Review | Review requirements with users and stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness. |

## Product Backlog Development – Hospital System (Short Table)

| Topic                                | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| What is a Product Backlog?          | A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and requirements needed for the hospital system. |
| Purpose of Product Backlog          | Helps the team understand what to build, in what order, and why; ensures transparency and alignment. |
| How to Create a Backlog             | Identify user needs, gather requirements, write user stories, define priorities, and estimate effort. |
| Structuring the Backlog             | Organize items by epics, user stories, priority, business value, and dependencies. |
| Prioritization Techniques           | MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won’t), Value vs. Effort, Kano Model, WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First). |
| Backlog Refinement                  | Regularly updating, splitting stories, improving clarity, and re-estimating based on feedback. |
| Maintenance Importance              | Ensures backlog stays accurate, manageable, and aligned with hospital workflow needs. |
