Weighting and Estimation for Hospital System (Simple Explanation)
1. Story Point Estimation Techniques

Story points are a way to measure how big or difficult a user story is. They do not represent hours; they show effort, complexity, and risk.
Common story point scales: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… (Fibonacci).

When estimating for a hospital system (e.g., patient registration, appointment scheduling, lab reports), teams look at:

Complexity (How technically challenging is it?)

Effort (How much work is needed?)

Uncertainty (Any risks or unknowns?)

Example:
Creating a patient registration form = low complexity → small points
Building a lab management system = high complexity → large points

2. Methods Used for Estimation

There are several simple techniques used by Agile teams:

• Planning Poker

Team members get cards showing numbers (1, 2, 3, 5…)

The user story is read out (e.g., “As a doctor, I want to see patient history”).

Everyone picks a card secretly.

Cards are shown together.

If numbers differ, the team discusses why and agrees on one value.

This helps avoid bias and brings team understanding.

• T-Shirt Sizing

User stories are grouped into sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL.
Later, each size is linked to story points.

Example in hospital system:

XS → Display doctor list

M → Manage appointments

XL → Build electronic medical records (EMR)

This method is useful at the beginning when details are not clear.

• Three-Point Estimation

Team gives three values:

Optimistic (O) – best case

Pessimistic (P) – worst case

Most likely (M)

Then they calculate expected size using a formula.
Good for risky or unclear hospital features like “Emergency triage system”.

3. How to Weight User Stories

User stories are weighted based on three factors:

• Complexity

How difficult is the task?

Simple form → low complexity

Integrating with lab machines or pharmacy → high complexity

Complexity directly increases story points.

• Priority

How important is the story for hospital operation?

High priority → features needed immediately (patient admission, billing)

Medium priority → improves workflow

Low priority → nice-to-have features

High priority does not always mean high story points. It's about need, not size.

• Business Value

How much benefit does the feature bring to the hospital?
Examples:

High value → reduces waiting time, increases accuracy (e.g., appointment scheduling).

Medium value → makes staff work easier.

Low value → cosmetic improvements.

Business value helps decide what to build first.

Summary (Very Simple)

Story points measure effort, not hours.

Planning Poker, T-shirt sizing, and Three-Point are common estimation methods.

User stories are weighted by complexity (how hard), priority (how needed), and business value (how useful).
