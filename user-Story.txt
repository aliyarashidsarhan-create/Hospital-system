1. What are User Stories and Their Format

A user story is a short description of a feature from the perspective of the person who wants it. It focuses on who wants it, what they want, and why they want it.

Format:

As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit].


Example for a hospital system:

As a patient, I want to book an appointment online so that I don’t have to wait in line.

As a doctor, I want to view patient medical history so that I can provide better treatment.

As a nurse, I want to update patient vitals so that records are always accurate.

2. How to Write Effective User Stories

To make user stories effective:

Keep them simple and clear – Avoid technical jargon.

Focus on user needs – Describe the value for the user, not the system.

Small and manageable – Each story should be doable in a short period.

Independent – Stories should work on their own without depending on others.

Testable – You should be able to check if it’s done.

3. Acceptance Criteria and Their Importance

Acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for a story to be considered complete. They make the story testable and ensure everyone understands what “done” means.

Example:
User Story: As a patient, I want to book an appointment online so that I don’t have to wait in line.
Acceptance Criteria:

The patient can select a doctor and available time slot.

The system confirms the booking via email.

The patient can cancel or reschedule the appointment.

Importance:

Ensures clarity between developers and users.

Helps in testing and quality assurance.

Prevents misunderstandings about functionality.
